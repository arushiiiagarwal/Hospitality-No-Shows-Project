# Patient-No-Shows-Project
I have created this project using Python. Performed exploratory data analysis and also performed Statistical Tests. I have used libraries such as Pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib for EDA.
I have Cleaned and processed 100K+ patient appointment records using Pandas and NumPy. Performed EDA with Seaborn and Matplotlib
Also Applied t-tests, chi-square tests, and correlation analysis to identify factors influencing patient no-show rates
